### What?

I completed the [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) book using [Zig](https://ziglang.org/).

### Why?

That is a good question without a singular answer.
- Zig has caught my eye as an interesting language based on principles I sympathize with.
- I wanted to try something completely new to me.
- I have come across people recommending this book multiple times in various forums so I figured it must be worthwhile.

### Summary

This project was a fun way to challenge myself in learning something new. The book's code was written in c++ but I am glad I used Zig because it forced me to think more about the code I was writting rather than just copying the code word for word. I definitely did not come out of this understanding 100% of the math required to make this program work, however, it was fun to brush up on some of my math skills that I have not used since college. One of the more exciting parts for me were the sections about camera positioning and defocus blur because the concepts were so closely related to photography which is another hobby of mine. Overall, I would recommend this book to anyone interested.
